# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the complete development and enhancement of a distributed order management system. The system demonstrates advanced microservices patterns including Event Sourcing, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and event-driven architecture. The project requires both backend corrections/improvements and a complete modern frontend implementation using React 18 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all backend microservices to be fully functional and error-free, so that the distributed order management system operates reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is built THEN all 4 microservices SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN services are started THEN they SHALL successfully connect to PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ
3. WHEN inter-service communication occurs THEN message serialization/deserialization SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN services SHALL implement proper circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN invalid data is received THEN services SHALL validate input and return appropriate error responses
6. WHEN health checks are requested THEN all services SHALL respond with accurate health status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and resilience patterns implemented, so that the system can gracefully handle failures and provide meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections fail THEN services SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN RabbitMQ is unavailable THEN services SHALL queue messages locally until connection is restored
3. WHEN downstream services are slow THEN circuit breakers SHALL prevent cascade failures
4. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be logged with correlation IDs for tracing
5. WHEN validation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be returned to clients
6. WHEN timeouts occur THEN appropriate HTTP status codes SHALL be returned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a modern, responsive web interface to manage orders, so that I can efficiently perform all order management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the interface SHALL be built with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
2. WHEN interacting with UI components THEN they SHALL use exclusively shadcn/ui components
3. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the interface SHALL provide real-time feedback via toast notifications
5. WHEN data loads THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be displayed using shadcn/ui components
6. WHEN errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a comprehensive dashboard with real-time metrics and visualizations, so that I can monitor system performance and business KPIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN key metrics SHALL be displayed in shadcn/ui cards
2. WHEN data changes THEN charts SHALL update in real-time using Recharts integration
3. WHEN viewing metrics THEN different chart types SHALL be available (area, bar, pie charts)
4. WHEN filtering data THEN dashboard SHALL support date ranges and status filters
5. WHEN exporting data THEN dashboard SHALL provide export functionality
6. WHEN switching themes THEN all charts SHALL adapt to dark/light mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an order manager, I want complete CRUD operations for orders with advanced table features, so that I can efficiently manage all order-related tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing orders THEN they SHALL be displayed in a shadcn/ui data table with sorting
2. WHEN searching orders THEN table SHALL support filtering by multiple criteria
3. WHEN managing large datasets THEN table SHALL implement pagination
4. WHEN creating orders THEN a modal dialog SHALL provide form validation using Zod
5. WHEN editing orders THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately in the table
6. WHEN deleting orders THEN confirmation dialog SHALL prevent accidental deletions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates throughout the application, so that I can see changes as they happen without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orders are created THEN real-time notifications SHALL appear via WebSocket
2. WHEN payments are processed THEN status updates SHALL be pushed to connected clients
3. WHEN inventory changes THEN stock levels SHALL update automatically
4. WHEN system events occur THEN toast notifications SHALL inform users
5. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
6. WHEN reconnected THEN missed updates SHALL be synchronized

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive inventory management features, so that I can track and manage product stock levels effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing inventory THEN products SHALL be displayed in a responsive grid using shadcn/ui cards
2. WHEN stock levels change THEN updates SHALL be reflected in real-time
3. WHEN stock is low THEN visual indicators SHALL alert users
4. WHEN managing products THEN CRUD operations SHALL be available
5. WHEN reserving inventory THEN the system SHALL prevent overselling
6. WHEN inventory operations fail THEN appropriate rollback mechanisms SHALL execute

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a financial administrator, I want to monitor all payment transactions with detailed status tracking, so that I can ensure payment processing integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing payments THEN status SHALL be clearly indicated with shadcn/ui badges
2. WHEN payments are processed THEN detailed transaction logs SHALL be available
3. WHEN payment failures occur THEN retry mechanisms SHALL be available
4. WHEN viewing payment history THEN filtering and sorting SHALL be supported
5. WHEN payment status changes THEN notifications SHALL be sent to relevant users
6. WHEN generating reports THEN payment data SHALL be exportable

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be deployment-ready for Railway.app, so that it can be easily deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN Docker multi-stage builds SHALL be configured
2. WHEN deploying THEN all services SHALL be included in docker-compose configuration
3. WHEN accessing the application THEN Nginx SHALL serve as reverse proxy
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured for Railway
5. WHEN scaling is required THEN services SHALL be stateless and horizontally scalable
6. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN health checks SHALL be exposed for all services

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive form handling with validation, so that data integrity is maintained throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating forms THEN React Hook Form SHALL be used with shadcn/ui form components
2. WHEN validating input THEN Zod schemas SHALL define validation rules
3. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL be displayed inline
4. WHEN submitting forms THEN loading states SHALL prevent double submission
5. WHEN forms are complex THEN multi-step wizards SHALL be supported
6. WHEN data is saved THEN success feedback SHALL be provided to users
