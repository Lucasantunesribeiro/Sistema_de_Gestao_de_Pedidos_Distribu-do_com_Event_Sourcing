# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical debugging and deployment unification needs for a distributed order management system. The system currently experiences a 500 Internal Server Error on the GET /api/orders endpoint after order creation, and requires deployment architecture changes to unify all services (frontend + 4 microservices) into a single deployable unit on Render.com. The system uses Event Sourcing, CQRS, RabbitMQ for messaging, and consists of Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, and Query Service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the critical 500 Internal Server Error on GET /api/orders to be identified and resolved, so that users can successfully retrieve order data after creating orders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new order is created THEN the Query Service SHALL successfully process the order creation event
2. WHEN GET /api/orders is called after order creation THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with order data
3. WHEN RabbitMQ events are published by Order Service THEN they SHALL be consumed correctly by Query Service
4. WHEN event projection fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL prevent 500 errors
5. WHEN database operations fail in Query Service THEN proper exception handling SHALL return meaningful error responses
6. WHEN debugging the issue THEN comprehensive logging SHALL be added to identify the root cause

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze and verify that all architectural patterns (Event Sourcing, CQRS, RabbitMQ communication) are properly implemented, so that the system functions as designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the Order Service THEN Event Sourcing SHALL be properly implemented with event persistence
2. WHEN examining the Query Service THEN CQRS read models SHALL be correctly updated from events
3. WHEN examining inter-service communication THEN RabbitMQ message publishing and consumption SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN examining the system architecture THEN all four microservices SHALL have clearly defined responsibilities
5. WHEN missing functionality is identified THEN it SHALL be implemented according to the architectural patterns
6. WHEN API routes are incomplete THEN they SHALL be added to match the system requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to unify the deployment of frontend and all backend services into a single container, so that the entire system can be deployed as one unit on Render.com.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the unified container THEN a multi-stage Dockerfile SHALL build both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN the container runs THEN Supervisor SHALL manage all four Java microservices as separate processes
3. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN Nginx SHALL act as a reverse proxy routing API calls to appropriate services
4. WHEN serving the frontend THEN Nginx SHALL serve React static files from the root path
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL be proxied to the correct internal service ports
6. WHEN the container starts THEN all services SHALL initialize in the correct order with proper health checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging capabilities in the frontend, so that API communication issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN detailed console logging SHALL show request URLs, methods, and payloads
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN console logging SHALL show response status, headers, and data
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN console logging SHALL show complete error details including stack traces
4. WHEN debugging network issues THEN request/response timing information SHALL be available
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed while maintaining detailed logs
6. WHEN testing the system THEN all API endpoints SHALL be easily testable through the frontend interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want proper service orchestration and process management, so that all services start reliably and can be monitored in the unified deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container starts THEN Supervisor SHALL be configured to manage all Java processes
2. WHEN a service crashes THEN Supervisor SHALL automatically restart the failed service
3. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL wait for dependencies (databases, RabbitMQ) to be ready
4. WHEN monitoring services THEN health check endpoints SHALL be accessible through the unified deployment
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the container SHALL be designed to support horizontal scaling
6. WHEN logs are needed THEN all service logs SHALL be accessible through the container runtime

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the Nginx configuration to properly handle both static file serving and API proxying, so that the unified deployment serves all application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root path THEN Nginx SHALL serve the React frontend static files
2. WHEN API calls are made to /api/orders THEN they SHALL be proxied to the Query Service
3. WHEN API calls are made to /api/payments THEN they SHALL be proxied to the Payment Service  
4. WHEN API calls are made to /api/inventory THEN they SHALL be proxied to the Inventory Service
5. WHEN API calls are made to order creation endpoints THEN they SHALL be proxied to the Order Service
6. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL be served with appropriate caching headers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper environment configuration for the unified deployment, so that all services can connect to external dependencies correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Render.com THEN environment variables SHALL be properly configured for all services
2. WHEN services need database connections THEN connection strings SHALL be correctly set for each service
3. WHEN RabbitMQ connection is needed THEN all services SHALL use the same message broker configuration
4. WHEN different environments are used THEN configuration SHALL be externalized and environment-specific
5. WHEN secrets are needed THEN they SHALL be securely managed through environment variables
6. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL validate their configuration and fail fast if misconfigured
