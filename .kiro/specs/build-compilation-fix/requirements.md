# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The unified order system is experiencing multiple compilation errors due to missing DTOs, improper controller annotations, and architectural mismatches between test expectations and actual implementation. This feature will systematically resolve all compilation issues by creating missing classes, properly structuring the Spring Boot application, and ensuring consistency between the service layer, controllers, and tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all compilation errors to be resolved so that the application can build successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Maven build is executed THEN the system SHALL compile without any errors
2. WHEN tests are run THEN all missing class symbols SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all Spring Boot components SHALL be properly configured

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper DTO classes for all API operations so that the system has type safety and clear contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating payment requests THEN the system SHALL have a PaymentRequest DTO class
2. WHEN processing payment responses THEN the system SHALL have a PaymentResponse DTO class  
3. WHEN handling customer information THEN the system SHALL have a CustomerInfo DTO class
4. WHEN the PaymentMethod enum is used THEN it SHALL include all required values including BOLETO
5. WHEN CreateOrderRequest is used THEN it SHALL have proper constructor overloads and correlation ID support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly annotated Spring Boot controllers so that the REST API endpoints work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OrderController is used THEN it SHALL be annotated with @RestController
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL be properly mapped with @RequestMapping annotations
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all controllers SHALL be registered as Spring beans
4. WHEN requests are made THEN proper HTTP status codes SHALL be returned

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent service layer interfaces so that all components integrate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the InventoryService is called THEN it SHALL have consistent method signatures matching test expectations
2. WHEN inventory operations are performed THEN the system SHALL support both reservation ID and item list parameters
3. WHEN service methods are invoked THEN they SHALL return proper DTO objects instead of Map<String, Object>
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN all service dependencies SHALL be properly mocked

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to compile and run successfully so that I can verify system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN all test classes SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN MockMvc is used THEN it SHALL work with proper Spring Boot controller annotations
3. WHEN test assertions are made THEN they SHALL work with proper DTO return types
4. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL use consistent request/response objects

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation so that the API behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid requests are sent THEN the system SHALL return proper validation error responses
2. WHEN DTO validation fails THEN appropriate HTTP 400 responses SHALL be returned
3. WHEN service errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly propagated to the controller layer
4. WHEN exception handling is needed THEN proper Spring Boot exception handlers SHALL be in place
